## During the development of this project, I practiced:
- React project architecture and Clean Code best practices
- Next13 application structure
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex using Tailwind CSS
- From soft and pleasant animations to complex gradients using Framer Motion
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost  all devices
- how to deploy website and give it a custom domain name (paid service).
- how to deploy website on vercel platform.

Since i have deployed on vercel you can check the website on: https://horus-6sc3c534w-leonardooesteves.vercel.app/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# :sparkling\_heart: Support the project

I open-source almost everything I can and try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously,
this takes time. You can use this service for free.

However, if you are using this project and are happy with it or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, there are a few ways you can do it:

*   Giving proper credit when you use github-readme-stats on your readme, linking back to it :D
*   Starring and sharing the project :rocket:
*   - You can make one-time donations via PayPal. I'll probably buy a ~~coffee~~ tea. :tea:

Thanks! :heart:

Made with :heart: and Next.js.
